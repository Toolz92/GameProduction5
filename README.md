# GameProduction5
An online multiplayer shooter build for Game Production 5 in my third year at GBC.

This is a online shooter in the same vien as Unreal Tournament with gun and health pickups. 
  Core gameplay was completed with functional weapon and health pickups, as well as 
  player health and respawning, all functioning in an online environment. 

Work on this game was halted when I was moved from Game Produciton 5 to work with 
  grad students on their games.
